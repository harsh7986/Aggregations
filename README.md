Certainly! Here's a **theoretical summary** of **Task 6: Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations**:

---

### ðŸ“˜ **Theoretical Summary**

#### **Objective:**
The goal of this task is to analyze the **sales trends** of an e-commerce platform by examining the **monthly revenue** and **order volume** from the `online_sales` dataset. This provides insights into business performance over time and helps identify seasonal patterns or sales spikes.

### ðŸ§© **Key Concepts and Functions Used**

| Concept                         | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Date Functions**               | `YEAR(order_date)` and `MONTH(order_date)` are used to break down data by calendar year and month. |
| **Aggregation Functions**        | `SUM(amount)` calculates total revenue, and `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)` counts the number of unique orders per month. |
| **Grouping and Sorting**         | `GROUP BY` is applied on year and month to summarize the data monthly, and `ORDER BY` arranges the results in chronological order. |
| **Filtering Data**               | A `WHERE` clause restricts the analysis to a specific time period, such as the year 2023. |

### ðŸ§® **Formula Logic:**

- **Revenue**:  
  `SUM(amount)`  
  This computes the total sales amount for each month.

- **Order Volume**:  
  `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)`  
  This ensures only unique orders are counted, preventing duplicates.

---

### ðŸ“Š **Expected Output:**
A table with the following columns:
- `order_year`: The year of the order
- `order_month`: The month of the order
- `total_revenue`: Total revenue generated in that month
- `order_volume`: Total number of unique orders in that month

This structure allows stakeholders to:
- Identify best-performing months
- Compare sales growth or decline over the year
- Spot seasonal trends or anomalies

### âœ… **Use Cases of This Analysis:**
- **Business Forecasting**
- **Marketing Strategy Planning**
- **Inventory Management**
- **Performance Monitoring**
